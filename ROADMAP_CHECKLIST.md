## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **NFS Protocol Complexity**: NFS protocol is complex with many edge cases
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication and security are critical
- **Performance Requirements**: High performance requirements may be challenging

### Medium Risk
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility across platforms
- **Integration Testing**: Complex integration testing requirements
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation requirements

### Low Risk
- **Build System**: Standardized build system is already in place
- **Basic Infrastructure**: Core daemon infrastructure can be adapted
- **Development Tools**: Development tools and CI/CD are available
